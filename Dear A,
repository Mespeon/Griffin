My dearest (does that sound too corny?)

I wanted to write you a love letter, but it’s going to sound more like a thank you note. Maybe it’s both. I want to thank you for washing the dishes when I forget my dirty ones are still in the sink. I want to thank you for agreeing to watch shitty reality shows with me and letting me pick the songs during car rides even though we have completely different tastes. I want to thank you for all of the hugs you have offered me to squeeze the sadness out and all of the pep talks you have given me when I doubted myself. Most of all, I want to thank you for existing. Thank you for being my partner. Thank you for being my best friend in the world.

Honey,

I don’t want to wait until your birthday or our anniversary to remind you how much you mean to me. Hint: You mean everything. I know I don’t always say how I’m feeling because I have a nasty habit of keeping my heart guarded, but I hope you realize how much I care about you. I never thought it was possible to have this much love for someone, I never thought my heart could handle it. I know there are days when we argue and don’t see eye-to-eye, but you are the only person I would want to have those arguments with. (Besides, the make up sex isn’t half bad).
